German Policy Agendas
================

## General Information

All data available in this repo originally haven been coded following
the German specific codebook. The latest version is available on the
[Comparative Agendas website](https://www.comparativeagendas.net). To
ensure the international comparability, German specific categories have
been converted into the categories from the master codebook of the
Comparative Agenda Project. German specific codes are available on
request.

Human coders working on the German Policy Agendas are trained on
previously coded data. The training data assembles documents of each
class coded as part of the project; e.g. laws and bills, executive
statements etc. The topics and documents included in the training data
are of increasing difficulty. The coding of original data is done at
least double-blind, most often triple-blind following the training. If
there is no overlap between all coders then cases are discussed with a
principle investigator. Instances that the coders and the principle
investigator cannot agree on are referred to the whole project group,
including the project director. If no consensus is reached among the
whole project group then a vote on the coding takes place.

These datasets have been published in the [Journal of Legislative
Studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13572334.2021.2010395).
